Refactored React_ecommerce project

1) Converted Products page to a prop in app.js
2) Added extra components that were added to Products.js
  - Filter.js
  - ProductCard.js
  - Sort.js
3) Added a function that added categories into my Filter
  - This made sure to only show certain products like Controllers or consoles
